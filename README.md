# 2D Evolution
An original 2d evolution/darwinism simulation built with Processing.

Each circle represents an organism with two distinct traits - size and speed. The smaller the size, the faster they move and the bigger, the slower they move. These organisms have a health that slowly expires unless they run into food, represented by squares, which revives them. If each organism survives to a certain age, it gives birth to offspring that inherit the same traits. This simulation predictably leads to a homogeneous populaiton of medium sized organisms.
